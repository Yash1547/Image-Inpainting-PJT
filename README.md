# Image-Inpainting-PJT

## Introduction
Image inpainting is a technique used to fill in missing parts of an image in a visually plausible way. In this project, we use GANs to perform image inpainting, demonstrating the power of deep learning in image restoration tasks.

## Features
- Uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to fill in missing parts of images.
- Includes functions to train the model's discriminator and generator.
- Robust system for fixing damaged image regions.
- Demonstrates proficiency in GAN-based image synthesis and restoration techniques.

Here are some sample results of the image inpainting:
